# Matplotlib-Pyber
In this project I used matplotlib to plot graphs displaying the average city fare per city type, rides per city type and determine which city type (urban, suburban, or rural areas) charge the highest or lowest and decide as to what type of conclusions and inferences can be drawn to maybe address trends displayed from the data provided.
